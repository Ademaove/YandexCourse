Shunting yard algorithm is quite known in the Computer Science area. You can look it up in Wikipedia for better description.
{In computer science, the shunting-yard algorithm is a method for parsing mathematical expressions specified in infix notation. It can produce either a postfix notation string, also known as Reverse Polish notation (RPN), or an abstract syntax tree (AST).}
